### Simplest way possible

Just asking regularly and answering:

- **What did you do during the last hour?**
- **What do you want to do during the next hour?**

That's it.

### In an ideal world

You start the day (let's say at 9am).

The group (let's say 4 people) stands up.

Someone asks the question:

**What do you want to do today?**

Each person takes turn replying and shares their goals for the day.

Then someone asks the question:

**What do you want to do in the next hour?**

Each person takes turn replying and shares their goals for the hour.

**Everybody works for the next 45 minutes**.

Then the group meets at 9:45am and someone asks:

**What did you do during the last hour?**

Each person takes turn replying and shares what they did.

Then everybody takes a short break.

And then it repeats, e.g. **What do you wan to do for the next hour?**, **working**, **What did you do?**.

Then at the end of the day we ask an extra question:

**What did you do today?**

And that's it.

### Tips

There should be no interuptions or discussions during the rounds of talking.

You should keep the summary brief as to not take too much time for everybody but still precise enough so that it's concrete.

The breaks should not be mentally stimulative, they should help relax.

May be better to meet at :55, e.g. 10:55am, 11:55am, etc. because of meeting at round hours where people have to be on time but can leave earlier.

You can do it from 2 people to 6 people easily. With more people it's better to split the group.

### Variations

Breaks are optional, depends on the group and the context.

Answering questions are optional and can be skipped.

The interval can be 2 hours instead of 1 hour.

### Break ideas

- Walking around the area while talking
- Walking silently and then talking about what we noticed
- Meditating
- Biking
- Playing soccer
- Running
- Coffee break
- Smoke break
- etc.
